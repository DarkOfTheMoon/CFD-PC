## Overview
interThermalPhaseChangeFoam is an extensible open source volume-of-fluid (VOF) based simulation tool for studying two-phase fluid flows with thermally driven phase phenomena. The solver approach is based on the adiabatic two-phase interFoam code developed by [OpenCFD Ltd.](http://openfoam.com/). Target applications for interThermalPhaseChangeFoam include:

* Film condensation
* Dropwise condensation
* Evaporation
* Nucleate boiling
